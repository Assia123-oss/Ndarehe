# Role-Based Redirection Testing Guide

## Overview
This project now implements proper role-based redirection where:
- **ADMIN** users are redirected to `/admin` dashboard
- **USER** users are redirected to `/dashboard` 
- **PROVIDER** users are redirected to `/provider-dashboard`

## Test Users
The database is seeded with test users:

### Admin User
- **Email**: `admin@ndarehe.com`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Role**: `ADMIN`
- **Expected Redirect**: `/admin`

### Regular User
- **Email**: `user@ndarehe.com`
- **Password**: `user123`
- **Role**: `USER`
- **Expected Redirect**: `/dashboard`

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Admin Redirection
1. Navigate to `/login`
2. Login with `admin@ndarehe.com` / `admin123`
3. Should be redirected to `/admin` dashboard
4. Check browser console for debug logs

### 2. Test User Redirection
1. Navigate to `/login`
2. Login with `user@ndarehe.com` / `user123`
3. Should be redirected to `/dashboard`
4. Check browser console for debug logs

### 3. Test Root Route Redirection
1. Login with any user
2. Navigate to `/` (root route)
3. Should be automatically redirected to appropriate dashboard based on role
4. Check browser console for debug logs

### 4. Test Protected Routes
1. Try to access `/admin` as a regular user
2. Should be redirected to appropriate dashboard
3. Try to access `/dashboard` as an admin
4. Should be redirected to `/admin`

## Debug Components

### DebugAuth Component
- Shows current authentication status in top-right corner
- **Red**: No token
- **Yellow**: Token exists but no user data
- **Green**: User authenticated with role

### Console Logging
- Check browser console for detailed authentication flow logs
- Look for "RootRouteHandler", "useAuth", and "Login" logs

## Implementation Details

### Components
- `RootRouteHandler`: Handles root route redirection
- `RoleBasedRoute`: Protects routes based on user roles
- `ProtectedRoute`: General authentication protection

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in â†’ receives JWT token with role
2. Token stored in localStorage
3. Token decoded to extract user role
4. Role-based redirection applied
5. Protected routes enforce role restrictions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Infinite redirects**: Check RoleBasedRoute logic
2. **Role not detected**: Verify JWT token structure
3. **Redirection not working**: Check console for errors

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for logs
2. Verify localStorage has token
3. Check JWT token payload structure
4. Verify user role in database

## Production Notes
- Remove `DebugAuth` component before deployment
- Remove console.log statements
- Ensure proper error handling
- Test with real user accounts
